# An ARK script for AutoHotKey
###### since I like the game but I'm too lazy to perform all these automated operations

Pre-requisites:
- AutoHotKey
- Ark

Performed operations:
- autowalk: keep walking forward (middle mouse click, ALT-W)
- autoinfo: shows some useful info about weather and character (ALT-H)
- autoclick: click left mouse every 50 milliseconds, perfect if you've got to eat a ton berries (F8)
- "autofeed": every x milliseconds click on the 4th element in your inventory and send it to the pet inventory (F9)
- "autotame": every x milliseconds click on the 3rd element in the inventory and click on the "Remote Use" (F10)


Note: this stuff has been written and is currently used on a 1980x1020 screen resolution so the autofeed and autotame might now work properly if you try them on different resolutions.
